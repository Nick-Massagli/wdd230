            <h4>Honda Metro Scooter</h4>
            <p>Here’s a little secret everyone in Europe learned a long time ago: A scooter makes life about a thousand times easier, especially in the city. And here’s the second part of the secret: A scooter makes life a lot more fun too. Especially if you’re talking about one of the best scooters on the planet—the 2024 Honda Metropolitan. Features like its step-through design, no-shift automatic transmission and electric starter make it easy to operate. Lockable under-seat storage puts a big check in the practicality box. Classic scooter styling, epic fuel efficiency and world-famous Honda engineering make the Metropolitan the smartest choice you’ll make this year.</p>
            <h4>Honda Dio Scooter</h4>
            <p>Stylish looks, aesthetic design, and functional features compact in one scooter – The New DIO.

With the ability to smoothly navigate through traffic, finding convenient parking spots becomes a breeze, and you can trust in Honda's impeccable build quality. The urban scooter comes with spacious underseat storage and excellent fuel efficiency, making it perfect for daily errands and commuting to classes. Additionally, every ride is not only enjoyable but also safe as it is equipped with standard front-wheel ABS.</p>
            <h4>Honda Pioneer ATV</h4>
            <p>The 2023 Pioneer 1000 line is built to deliver on every farm, every ranch, every worksite. But that doesn’t mean they don’t know how to have some fun too. And with four models to choose from, you can find one tailored to your needs. Like the Forest Edition that’s ready to explore. The Trail Edition that craves high-speed action. And the 1000 Deluxe models that won’t hold you back, or let you down. Each one is equipped to deliver best-in-class features, comfort, power and performance, alongside that legendary Honda reliability. And this year, we’ve even given them some new graphics and color options. If you want your Pioneer 1000 to carry a couple more passengers, then check out the Pioneer 1000-5 with QuickFlip® seating, featuring two stowaway seats right in the cargo bed.
